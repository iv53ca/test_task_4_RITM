This is a test project for calculation problem about mathematical pendulum  in system with periodical gravity acceleration and external force from fastening rod. 
.ipynb file consists of 5 parts: 
1. basic calculation of RK4 for demonstration
2. analytical solution for x(t) and y(t)
3. error comparison during one calculation depending on current time
4. error evolution analysis in dependence on time step dt
5. trajectory analysis in dependence on T, m, L

To run this project you need Python version 3.11.3 and following packages in venv:
``` bash
pip3 install numpy==1.24.3
pip3 install matplotlib==3.7.1
```

To launch project run test_task_4_ritm.ipynb
